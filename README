These are some Ruby scripts I created with the help of the internet to pull data from our MS Dynamics Great Plains SQL server.
Overall, these are just examples of using Ruby to pull SQL data, format and email it.


Config.rb = SQL/Email server config info
Weekly_New_Projects.rb = HTML email of new projects entered in the past week (requires GP with Project Accounting)
Daily_New_Projects.rb = HTML email of new projects entered in the past day (requires GP with Project Accounting)
